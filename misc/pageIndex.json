    " Eternal trials   General  The eternal trials are the only alternative gamemode besides the main levels. In contrast to the normal maps, the eternal trials are an endless mode. Just like rogue-like games, the players loses all progress and power-ups upon being defeated.  Gameplay  The eternal trials consists of stages. At the start of each stage the player is offered three options. Each option shows a map, a weapon and two perks. After the player has chosen an option, they will have to play on the selected map with their respective weapon and will obtain the two chosen perks for the rest of their run. This means that the player has 2 perks on stage 1, 4 perks on stage 2, 6 perks on stage 3 and so on. While the maps, weapons and perks are chosen by the player, they have to fight a randomised set of enemies each stage. The player has to face a random number of waves per map. The enemies in each of those waves are also randomly generated, meaning the player will face enemies that do not normally spawn on a specific map (see below for more details on wave generation). If the player manages to beat all the waves, they move on and are able to select the map, the weapon and the two perks for the next stage. The difficulty of the game increases with each stage (see below for more details on difficulty increases). After the players castle center eventually gets destroyed, they lose. All of their previous scores from each stage will be added together and the player receives a score bonus, increasing with each stage they have won. The stage bonus is calculated using this formular: (Won Stages)² ×10 000. After the player has received their final score, they lose all their perks and they may start another run.  Patterns  At the start of each stage, the wave generator uses a bunch of chances to determine which patterns the waves of the stage will have. Some possibilities are: Mono-battle stages, where you encounter the same one enemy type in every single wave (1.7%) and Mono-spawn stages, where enemies only spawn from one spawn point (10%). Additionally, other parts of the stage are determined, such as: Starting economy (low, medium, high, extreme-high) Spawn locations (random 1, random2, fixed 1, fixed 2,...) Enemy types (random 1, random 2, fixed 1, fixed 2, siege, ...) Wave durations Last wave bonus Amount of elite enemies (none, small part, medium part, large part) From stage 5 onwards the player always starts each stage with at least 11 gold.  Difficulty Points  The amount and power of enemies for each wave are determined by the amount of difficulty points. Difficulty points are a hidden statistic, purely in the background of the game. The amount of difficulty points per wave is determined by a complex calculation in the background of the game. It considers the current stage (the first 7 stages the difficulty increases exponentially, after that linearly), spawn location proximity to castle center (single multiplier), wave length (exponential) and simulated economy (this includes and is dependent on starting gold). When creating waves, the game spends the difficulty points to spawn enemies. For example 18 per exploder. Enemy Difficulty Points Archer 1.6 Catapult 6 Elite Crossbow Man 3.5 Exploder 18 Hunterling 2.4 Monster Rider 3.3 Ogre 17 Peasant 0.6 Racer 5 Ram 18 Slime 1 Spiky Slime 4.25 Swordsman 2 Wasp 5 Pikes 3 Fury 13 Barrel Knight 7 Flying Mage 8.5 Mole Knight 6.33 Mole Archer 4.88 Quicksling 18 Elite Enemies (Normal Version Difficulty Points) x6  Simulated Economy  As stated above, the game simulates the players economy on every given stage to increase the difficulty according to the amount of gold the player has at their disposal.  The game starts to simulate the players economy on day 1. It assumes that they put 50% into economy and 50% into defenses. The game also assumes that all economic buildings survive and calculates the players gold gain for the next day, which is again spent 50/50 in economy and defense. On the last two days, the game expects 100% of the available gold to be spent on defenses. This way the game consideres the total defense spending for each wave, by adding all previous defense spendings together.  In the end, the difficulty points are increased each wave, proportionally to the total defense spending up untill that respective wave. Some enemies have a \"Gold Limit\" value. It determines the minimum amount of gold the player has to have in defenses (according to the simulated economy), for it to be able to spawn.  Elite Enemies  Elite enemies are a special kind of enemies, that are unique to the eternal trials. They have 4x the hp and 3x the damage of their normal counterpart and are highlighted in the game by a special golden and spiky icon, as well as a golden outline. Elite enemies are converted from 6 normal enemies of their kind (and therefor also cost 6x their difficulty points) based on pre-generated patterns. If the total number of enemies exceeds 200, enemies are merged into the elite version of themselves, until the total number of enemies is below 200.

Quest: Complete a level with less than 15 secs of preparations timer between waves Devevelopers' Comment: This post received the most community upvotes by a long margin so how could we say no. The idea didn’t cross our mind before and it sure does sound like a fun new way to play Thronefall. We’ll think about where to best implement that into the game and give it a go go go! 🎖️ Gertimoshka - I like just the way they are Quest: Never move any of your own units from their starting positions. Devevelopers' Comment: Both we as well as the community liked the idea. We’ll find a way to put it into the game, probably as a mutator so you can’t accidentally move your units and mess up the quest. 🎖️ CaporalNico - The great Wall Quest: Before Night 3 build a wall or two they can protect your castle and don't lose it a single part of your wall Devevelopers' Comment: The idea of having to protect something specific came up a few times but protecting your walls seems like the most fun and intuitive twist on the idea. We’re not sure how well it would work as a quest (the rules don’t quite fit into the quests section), but we have some ideas and will find a way to make it work. Nice one. 🎖️ Hjorse Rider - One Man Army Quest: Thematically, you're a one man army who wins whichever battle you participate in. Devevelopers' Comment: This concept or idea came up multiple times in different variations. In Hjorse Rider’s version building towers would still be allowed but building units would not be. In other variants e.g. by FlediX2 you may only build and upgrade your castle center and nothing else. Hjorse Rider gets the win in this category for choosing the best name One Man Army '' and for receiving the most community upvotes. That being said, we find all of these options interesting and will likely explore different variations of this idea in the game."

    "Score",
    "/about/score.html",
    " Score   General  The score in Thronefall consists of 4 parts: 1. Base Score, 2. Gold Score, 3. Mutator Bonus, 4. No Restarts. At the end of the game all of them are added together to get the players score. This results in this formular (see sections below for more details): (Base Score + Gold x 10 + (Base Score + Gold x 10) x Mutator Multiplier) x No Restarts Bonus  Leaderboards  The game has an integrated leaderboard system, which can be used to compare your score against Steam-Friends. The community has created a Community Leaderboard, that shows the highest score achieved for each map.  Eternal Trials  The eternal trials are a special case in which each map gives the player a score, which is added up at the end of each stage. After the player has been defeated, all of their achieved scores are added up and a stage bonus is added. The stage bonus is calculated using this formular: (Won Stages)² × 10 000  Base Score  The Base Score consists of 3 Scores that are added together at the end of each night: 1. Night Survived, 2. Realm Protected, 3. Time Bonus. Night Survived: You gain +100 Score for surviving a night. Realm Protected: You gain up to +250 Score for protecting your buildings. If no building was destroyed, you gain +250 score. Everything below 100% protected is calculated with this formular: +250(NOT destroyed buildings ÷ total amount of buildings)². Note that each wall segment counts as a separate building. Time Bonus: You gain up to +250 Score for killing the enemies fast. You gain the full +250, if you kill all enemies up to 5s after the last enemy spawned. Every bonus below +250 is calculated with this formular: +250 × ( [90s − {total time − time of last spawn} ] ÷ 85s)². Note that this means, you will not gain any score, if you kill all enemies more than 90s after the last enemy has spawned.  Gold Score  The gold score is calculated with this formular: Unspent Gold x 10. This only includes the gold you have remaining at the end of the game and does NOT include gold you have spent to buy buildings or upgrades. All gold you generate on the last night is added to the gold score, even if you did not pick it up before the victory screen.  Mutators Bonus  The mutators bonus is only added, if you used a mutator. The bonus is calculated with this formular: (Base Score + Gold Score) x Mutators Multiplier. The mutators multiplier is influenced by how many and which mutators you have picked (see the table below for reference).  Mutators Multiplier  Mutator Single Multiplier Total Multiplier Tiger God x1.2 x1.2 Falcon God x1.2 x1.44 God of Destruction x1.2 x1.728 Wasp God x1.2 x2.074 God of Death x1.2 x2.488 Snake God x1.3 x3.235 Turtle God x1.4 x4.529  No Restarts Bonus  If the player did not use the restart function of the game, they are rewarded by an +10% increase of their score. This +10% applies to all the other Score: (Base Score + Gold Score + Mutator Bonus) x 1.1 If the player did use the restart function, their score is multiplied by 1, which means they do not recieve any further changes to their score instead.
